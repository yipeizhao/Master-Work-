# Master-Work-
Some algorithms/models built during master degree study.<br/>
I only publish projects that I found challenging. I don't have time to update everything I've done.(I will try once I am free)<br/>
If there is anything specific you want to see, please contact me and I will try my best.<br/>
Presented only for reference and demonstrating purposes.<br/>
Feel free to use them if you feel comfortable, there is no specific copyright for them, but please mention me at least.<br/>
You can be inspired by my code but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THEM FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENT!<br/>
All codes are wrote by myself, some of them are inspired by public resources.<br/>
Please drop me an email if you found anything interested about my code or myself.
